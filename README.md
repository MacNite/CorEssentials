# CorEssentials GAMMA
CorEssentials is an open source corexy 3D printer.

To Do list:
- Built Toolhead

# changes compared to BETA
- Base Frame built from 2020 extrusion to make the general structure easier to built and accessible for everyone
- 2 MGN9H rails for x-axis for vastly improve rigidity
- z-Axis with 3 independent stepper Motors with leadscrew
- 3mm thin outer panels (instead of 6mm - can be worked with easier without a CNC)
- support for Voron Afterburner Toolhead
- direct drive extruder (BMG) with integrated Filament Runout Sensor (comparable to Prusa MK3S)
- Trianglelab Dragon Hotend for easy nozzle change
- hotend cooling with 3010 fan
- part cooling with single 4020 blower
- chamber temperature control with thermistor and 140x25mm Fan

# changes compared to ALPHA
- Bed Leveling: Hardware bed leveling with 3 independent motors
- HEPA-Filter
- support for Dual Extrusion with E3D Chimera AQUA
- water cooling with Alphacool Eisbaer Solo
- 40mm more z-height
- better idler mount for xy motion
- better belt Tensioner for z-axis
- improved direct drive Tool Head with quick-swab hotends
- drag chain for xy gantry
